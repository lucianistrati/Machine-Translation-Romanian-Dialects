# Oltenizator, Moldovenizator, Ardelenizator, Dialectal MT
A spoken language is a living being. 
Is it possible to crawl different newspapers from different regions and observe the language differences? 
There is a corpus of Romanian dialectal varieties, how can this corpus be used to influence the output of an NMT system? (think of a language model fine-tuned on different dialects)
Can we introduce known rules to change an input sentence from passé composé to passé simple in romanian?
Can we use the existing dexlonline.ro database to find the regionalisms and replace them with the right declension, conjugation?
